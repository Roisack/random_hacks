Due to some fantastic improbabilities we encountered during a session of Battle for Wesnoth, there was a need to create a tool that truly expanded the probability calculations. Also, coding is fun. This javascript thingmazig takes a count of attacks performed against a percentage of defence (0...1), and then lists all the necessary odds.
