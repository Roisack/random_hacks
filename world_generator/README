I've always liked looking at world generators like in Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft. It's interesting to see the world take shape, be in the shoes of the all-mighty entity that defines the very fate of the universe. So I kind of want to try playing around with that stuff. Initially, height maps and 3D mountains, then adding seas and continents, then seeing what seems fit.
